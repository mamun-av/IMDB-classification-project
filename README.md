# IMDB-classification-project
This project is a basic classification that compares different classification models in term of classification accuracy. 
In this project, the dataset contains 28 variables for 5043 movies, spanning across 100 years in 66 countries. 
Their IMDB score will be divided in 2 groups: higher than 7 and lower or equal to 7.
Our classification models will try to classify the movie into those two groups.
